To start the game, you first need to select between a category of animals, countries, or food.

Then you would need to select between the difficulties easy or hard 

On the difficulty easy, once you successfully completed each letter in a word, your life count will always reset to 7 on the next word you are giving.

On the difficulty hard Your life count will carry on to the next word upon completion of previous words

Clicking hint once the game has started will provide you with a hint.

If you select the wrong letter the background of that letter on the grid of letters beside where the hanged man body goes will turn red, a sound will play indicating you selected the wrong letter, your life will decrease by one, and body parts of the hanged man will be added on the grid where the hanged man goes.

If you selected the right choice a sound will play indicating you made the right choice and the background of that letter will turn green on the grid of letters beside where the hanged man body goes.

Upon successful completion of every word you will receive a message in the hint field, to show that there is no more words for you to complete. 

On the other hand 

If you have depleted your life count to zero by clicking the wrong letters you will also receive a message in the hint field indicating you have no life's left, and you should click reset to start over. 

The reset button resets the game to its  default setting. It only works once a player has selcted a category and difficulty.

<!-- Next Step --> 

My future plans for this game in an attempt to enhance the player's experience: 


I plan on adding a feature where the player can select the range of words where they would like to complete. 

I plan on adding a theme to the game in order to keep players more engaged and invested in the game. 

I plan on adding a bit more categories so the player wonâ€™t feel limited in their category choices 

I plan on randomizing the approach to which words are giving, because after a while one starts to realize the order in which the words come, which gives a level of predictability to the game. 

The last thing I plan on doing is adding a database to the game to keep track of how far players gets in their attempts to successfully guess the letters in each word in each category
